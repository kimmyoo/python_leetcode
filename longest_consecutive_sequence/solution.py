"""
Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.

Example:
Input: [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.

# use dictiontary to keep distinct elements
# find lower end and go back the higher end and update current value. 
# don't forget to use max() update the res value. 
# don't forget empty list scenario. 
# remember to deal with repetitive elements in the list.
